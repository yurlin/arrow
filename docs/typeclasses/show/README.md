## Show

The `Show` typeclass abstracts the ability to obtain a `String` representation of any object.

It can be considered the typeclass equivalent of Java's `Object#toString`.

```kotlin
import arrow.*
import arrow.instances.*

IntShowInstance.show(1)
// 1
```

### Main Combinators

#### show

Given an instance of `F` it returns the `String` representation of this instance.

`fun show(a: F): String`

### Laws

Arrow provides [`ShowLaws`]({{ '/docs/typeclasses/laws#showlaws' | relative_url }}) in the form of test cases for internal verification of lawful instances and third party apps creating their own `Show` instances.

#### Creating your own `Show` instances

Show provides one special instance that can be potentially applicable to most datatypes.
It uses kotlin's `toString` method to get an object's literal representation.
This will work well in many cases, specially for data classes.

```kotlin
import arrow.core.*
import arrow.typeclasses.*

// Option is a data class with a single value
Show.any().show(Option.pure(1))
// Some(1)
```

See [Deriving and creating custom typeclass]({{ '/docs/patterns/glossary' | relative_url }}) to provide your own `Show` instances for custom datatypes.
